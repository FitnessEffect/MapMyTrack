# MapMyTrack

This application allows the user to record his trajectory when walking, running, biking or even driving. 
Thanks to mapkit the path will automatically start saving as soon as the user hits the record button. In addition, 
the distance will automatically be calculated as well. The user will also be able to modify the title and result.
All of the saved paths will be displayed in a tableview. 
The user has the possiblity to search for a specific run by name.
