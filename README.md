# MapMyTrack

This application allows the user to record his trajectory when walking, running, biking or even driving. 
Thanks to mapkit the path will automatically start saving as soon as the user hits the record button. In addition, 
the distance will automatically be calculated. The user has the option to customize the title and result of each entry.
All of the saved paths will be displayed in a tableview. 
The user has the possiblity to search for a specific run by name.
